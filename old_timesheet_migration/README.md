# Migration from timesheets

Hey NEOson, this path was made for migrate all time entrys from olds timesheets. The file **old_timesheet_migration.py** was made for take all the time entrys of the timesheets since 2017 and add in neodata. So, if want to migrate time entrys from another timesheet version, you have to check if the standard of excel file is the same.
